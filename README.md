# ark-cluster-helm

Created because I wanted to run a minimal Instance of a Ark Survival Ascended Cluster for me and my friends.

I before tried to deploy [ark-operator](https://github.com/AngellusMortis/ark-operator)

But it turns out there were a lot of things hardcoded or not exactly working for me and as I'm not good enough with Python to try to fix it I decided to full stop and go back to field 0 and start this.
